/*
This is what happened. You stored a reference to your <img> element in myImage. 
Next, you made its onclick event handler property equal to a function with no name 
(an "anonymous" function). So every time this element is clicked:
- The code retrieves the value of the image's src attribute.
- The code uses a conditional to check if the src value is equal to the path of the original image:
    > If it is, the code changes the src value to the path of the second image, 
 forcing the other image to be loaded inside the <img> element.
    > If it isn't (meaning it must already have changed), the src value swaps back to the original image path, 
    to the original state.

The setUserName() function contains a prompt() function, which displays a dialog box, similar to alert(). 
This prompt() function does more than alert(), asking the user to enter data, and storing it in a variable 
after the user clicks OK. In this case, we are asking the user to enter a name. 
Next, the code calls on an API localStorage, which allows us to store data in the browser and retrieve it later. 
We use localStorage's setItem() function to create and store a data item called 'name', 
setting its value to the myName variable which contains the user's entry for the name. 
Finally, we set the textContent of the heading to a string, plus the user's newly stored name.

This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, 
you need to select it first. 
Following that, the code set the value of the myHeading variable's textContent property
